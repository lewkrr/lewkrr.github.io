# Hi! I'm Luke Klein \nData Scientist at Large

I started out teaching statistics at UC Riverside, where I got to revamp the department's computing curriculum, before jumping into global health work at FHI 360. There, I built data pipelines, created custom visualizations, and published research on disease surveillance using geospatial modeling. These days, I work with R, Python, and advanced stats to turn complex data into clear insights.

What gets me excited? Diving into messy datasets and making them tell their story. I love teaching and collaborating with other analysts and data scientists, sharing techniques and learning from each other as we tackle challenging problems together. It's amazing to see colleagues light up when we crack a new data challenge.

Looking to join a data science team where I can put my stats and pipeline skills to work while continuing to grow as a Data Scientist and Statistician alongside collaborative colleagues.
