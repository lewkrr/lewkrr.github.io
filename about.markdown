# Hi! I'm Luke Klein - Data Scientist at Large

I started out teaching statistics at UC Riverside, where I got to revamp the department's computing curriculum, before jumping into global health work at FHI 360. There, I built data pipelines and published research on disease surveillance using geospatial modeling. These days, I work with R, Python, and advanced stats to turn complex data into clear insights.

What gets me excited? Diving into messy datasets and making them tell their story. I love teaching others to code and solving tough problems as part of a team. It's amazing to see colleagues light up when they crack their first data challenge.

Looking to join a data science team where I can put my stats and pipeline skills to work while growing as a Data Scientist and Statistician alongside collaborative colleagues.
